# Testing and Adapting Contract Behavior

## Before We Begin

Here we assume that you followed the first tutorial ([Creating and Deploying a Smart Contract](1-create-and-deploy/README.md)) and understand the concepts of messages, working with data, and the deployment process. If you don't, please follow the first tutorial and come back when you're comfortable with these concepts. This tutorial also uses the code from the previous one, so we suggest you copy it to a separate directory and work there.
