# TON Smart Contract Development with Tolk

Tolk is a smart contract development language for The Open Network (TON) blockchain, featuring a modern Kotlin-like syntax. Its compiler is a fork of the FunC compiler, so essentially, you get the same bytecode with a much friendlier syntax and fewer opportunities to make errors (see more on the differences and improvements [here](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-detail)).

These tutorials reflect my journey into the depths of smart contract development for TON. Each one is a step-by-step guide, with code extensively commented in key areas to provide context and details. Welcome aboard! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

# Tutorials

## üë∂ 1. Smart Contract Basics and Testing

### 1.1. [Create and Deploy a Smart Contract](1-1-create-smart-contract/README.md)

Create and deploy a smart contract. Test its behavior with internal and `get` messages.

### 1.2. [Test Smart Contract Behavior](1-2-tests/README.md)

Explore automated smart contract testing using Sandbox.

### 1.3. [Implement Conditional Logic, Part 1](1-3-opcodes-and-tdd-1/README.md)

Alter your smart contract's behavior with operation codes. Learn about exceptions and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### 1.4. [Implement Conditional Logic, Part 2](1-4-opcodes-and-tdd-2/README.md)

Use TDD to implement and test conditional behavior while handling edge cases.
