# TON Smart Contract Development with Tolk

Tolk is a smart contract development language for The Open Network (TON) blockchain, featuring a modern Kotlin-like syntax. Its compiler is a fork of the FunC compiler, so essentially, you get the same bytecode with a much friendlier syntax and fewer opportunities to make errors (see more on the differences and improvements [here](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-detail)).

These tutorials reflect my journey into the depths of smart contract development for TON. Each one is a step-by-step guide, with code extensively commented in key areas to provide context and details. Welcome aboard! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

## Before We Begin

### 1. Install Node.js

> (Skip this step if you already have it installed. Just make sure it's version 18 or later.)

On a Mac with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```
brew install node
```
Otherwise: [download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en) from the official site.

### 2. Choose an IDE

I'd suggest [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (it's the one I'm using, free for non-commercial use) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (free).

### 3. Add the Plugin/Extension for Tolk.

JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, IDEA) [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23382-ton) or VS Code [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ton-core.tolk-vscode).
