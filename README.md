# TON Smart Contract Development with Tolk

Tolk is a smart contract development language for The Open Network (TON) blockchain, featuring a modern Kotlin-like syntax. Its compiler is a fork of the FunC compiler, so essentially, you get the same bytecode with a much friendlier syntax and fewer opportunities for errors (see more on the differences and improvements [here](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-detail)).

These tutorials take you on a journey into the depths of smart contract development for TON, covering everything from the basics to advanced concepts and critical details. Each guide is step-by-step, with extensively commented code in key areas to provide context and clarity. Welcome aboard! 🏴‍☠️

# Tutorials

## 👶 1. Basics and Testing

### 1.1. [Create and Deploy a Smart Contract](1-1-create-smart-contract/README.md)

Create and deploy a simple counter smart contract with Blueprint. Test its behavior manually using internal and `get` messages.

### 1.2. [Test Smart Contract Behavior](1-2-tests/README.md)

Explore automated smart contract testing using Sandbox.

### 1.3. [Implement Conditional Logic, Part 1: Opcodes, Exceptions, and TDD](1-3-opcodes-and-tdd-1/README.md)

Modify your smart contract's behavior using operation codes. Learn about exceptions and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### 1.4. [Implement Conditional Logic, Part 2: Handling Valid Opcodes](1-4-opcodes-and-tdd-2/README.md)

Use TDD to implement and test conditional behavior while handling edge cases.

## 👦 2. Communication

### 2.1. [Addresses and States, Part 1: Raw Addresses and States](2-1-addresses-and-states-1/README.md)

To send a message, you need to know the address. Gain an in-depth understanding of raw addresses and account states on the TON Blockchain.

### 2.2. [Addresses and States, Part 2: User-Friendly Addresses](2-2-addresses-and-states-2/README.md)

🚧 **Coming Soon!** 🚧 Learn how to make the addresses you share safer for end users while ensuring correctness and indicating important traits.
